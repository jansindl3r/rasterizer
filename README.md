# Rastr

This is the Rasterizing filter for [nodesignfoundry.com](https://nodesignfoundry.com)

It gets hinted outlines from a hinted file and turns it into a font.

## TODO

- [ ]Find a way how to remove `scipy` dependency
- [ ] Turn this into a CLI `python3 rastr.py -i Times.otf -r 16 -o Times_16.ufoz`
